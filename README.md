# BCI Project
Brain Computer Interface Project as part of "Programming for DSAI" course at AIT

## Title : _not yet define_

This project is based on Machine Learning and EEG signal processing implementation. Online resources are required to explore more about the BCI applications. 

### Major objective
The aim of our group is to do comparative and explorative project for extending horizontal knowledge from previous (cited) studies. The aim of this study is not to find a better performing model (though it would be great if, with some luck, we could manage that). We are going to find reasons and alternative modeling procedures (Feature Engineering, different model constructions and synthetical exploration) for EEG Analysis.    

## Project progress submission on Sunday 17 October 2021

After mid-exam, group members had some discussion of the further procedures to conduct the project. Firstly, we would like to accumulate the resources related to the EEG and BCI theme. To make it easily accessible, we made the google spreadsheet for posting the online resources, textbooks and papers about EEG signal processing and ML association. The link is given below.

## Current tasks
  - Search for related documentation, online resources, research papers and textbooks
  - Search for established procedures of EEG signal analysis along with Machine Learning implementation
  - Explore Sample code + Dataset from open-source material or tutorials and go through previous research to **Find the gaps**

## Current issues (problem and struggling)
 - More knowledge required about EEG signal processing
 - Difficulties in understanding other research/tutorials
 
## Future tasks (including expected, some tentative)
  - Revise the gaps (recommendation) from previous studies
  - List out and choose most appropriate ways to conduct analysis
  - Implement and test the selected procedure as per previous studies suggestions
  - Compare, Discuss and Explore the EEG signal processing using ML in several ways
  - Conclude the project
