Brain Computer Interface Project as part of "Programming for DSAI" course at AIT

## Title : _not yet define_

This project is based on Machine Learning and EEG signal processing implementation. Online resources are required to explore more about the BCI applications. 

### Major objective
The aim of our group is to do comparative and explorative project for extending horizontal knowledge from previous (cited) studies. The aim of this study is not to find a better performing model (though it would be great if, with some luck, we could manage that). We are going to find reasons and alternative modeling procedures (Feature Engineering, different model constructions and synthetical exploration) for EEG Analysis.    

## Project progress submission on Sunday 17 October 2021

After mid-exam, group members had some discussion of the further procedures to conduct the project. Firstly, we would like to accumulate the resources related to the EEG and BCI theme. To make it easily accessible, we made the google spreadsheet for posting the online resources, textbooks and papers about EEG signal processing and ML association. The link is given below.

 ## Project progress submission on Sunday 24 October 2021
 
The main tasks of methodology and frameworks was concluded on this week. the main framework is to perform different features (from feature extraction methods) and several ML model sch as genreral ML, CNN, RNN etc. to explore the differences between result with what are the advantages and drawbacks of each analysis ways. References dataset is not summarized yet, but there are 2 intereseting dataset; DEAP and motor imagery datasets.

The provided tasks for each member

- **Thantham:** find the dataset, feature extraction methods, related source code, tools and adjust processing frameworks. 
- **Omer:** do experiment on artifact removal, dataset exploratory, points of study, and place methodology framwork framworks  
- **Cedric:** review and construct ML models or any CNN models for statement solutions for comparison in the project
- **Arsha:** Review and search for related source codes about feature extractions for several methods for further comparison

From group discussion, the study will be conducted to implement the available dataset for different features with handling several models. Then, comparison will consider whether the results are improved or not. Trying the dataset by various ways might provide the explorative information about the observation explaining more points for future studies about BCI and EEG signal analysis with ML
