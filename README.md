# BCI Project
Brain Computer Interface Project as part of "Programming for DSAI" course at AIT

## Title : <To be filled>

This projectis based on Mahcine Learning and EEG signal processing implementation. The online resources are required to explore more about the BCI applications. 

### Major objective
An aim of our group is to do comparative and explorative project for extending horizontal knowledge from previous(cited) studies. The aim of this study is not for finding the better performance of modeling (it could be somehow and luckily), but we are going to find the reasons and alternative modeling procedures (Feature Engineering, different model constructions and synthetical exploration).    

## Project progress submission on Sunday 17 October 2021

Since after mid-exam, group members had some discussion of the further procedures to conduct the project. Firstly, we would like to accumulate the resources related to the EEG and BCI theme. To make it esily accessible, we made the google spreadsheet for posting the online resources, textbooks and papers about EEG signal processing and ML association. Te link was below.

  **To be update.... **
  
## Current tasks
  - Search for related documentation, online resources, paper works and textbooks
  - Search for genereal procedures of EEG signal analysis along with Machine Learning implementation
  - Explore Sample code + Dataset from several paper works or tutorials to **Find the gaps**
  
## Future tasks (including expected, some may not conduct)
  - Revise the gaps (recommendation) from previous studies
  - List out and choose probably appropriate ways to conduct analysis
  - Conduct the selected procedure in various test following previous studies suggestions
  - Compare, Discuss and Explore the EEG signal processing using ML in several ways
  - Conclude the project
